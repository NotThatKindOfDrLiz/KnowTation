## 🌟 Long-Term Vision

KnowTation becomes:

✅ A personal, portable knowledge base for researchers, activists, creators, and communities.  
✅ A decentralized replacement for closed-source, expensive, fragile citation managers.  
✅ A bridge between **human knowledge creation** and **freedom technologies** like Nostr.

We build toward a web where:

> **Your ideas, your connections, your research — are truly yours.**
